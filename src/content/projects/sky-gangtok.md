## Reaching for the Clouds

**Sky Gangtok** is an architectural marvel designed to redefine the skyline of the capital. Standing taller than any residential structure in the region, it offers an unhindered 360-degree view of the Himalayas.

### The Concept
Inspired by the verticality of the pine forests, the structure uses a steel-frame exoskeleton to minimize internal columns, creating massive, open living spaces that float above the city.

> "A home in the clouds, where the only neighbor is the mountain mist."

### Amenities
* Rooftop Infinity Edge Pool
* Private Elevator Access for Penthouses
* Automated Climate Control
* 24/7 Concierge Service
