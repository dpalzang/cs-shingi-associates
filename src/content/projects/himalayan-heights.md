## Community & Nature

Located in the serene hills of Namchi, **The Himalayan Heights** was a landmark project for CS Singhi & Associates, focusing on community living integrated with traditional Sikkimese architecture.

### Design Philosophy
We utilized local stone and sustainable timber to ensure the villas blend into the hillside rather than dominating it. The project sold out within 3 months of launch, a testament to the demand for quality, nature-centric housing.

* **Eco-Friendly:** Rainwater harvesting systems installed in every unit.
* **Community:** Central clubhouse with view decks.
